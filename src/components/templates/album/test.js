                "Many of the best music in Queen showcases clever, hungry lyricism over mean New York beats. Concussive boom-bap era styles rule, like the battle attitude on the dis-everybody beat “Barbie Dreams”, which samples The Notorious B.I.G.’s “Just Playing (Dreams)”. Nicki, trying to find someone worthy of giving babies to (her words), is pretty nonplussed by what’s on the market, spitting “all these Bow Wow challenge niggas lying and shit / man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyeing my shit / drake worth a hundred milli, always buying me shit / but I don't know if the pussy wet or if he crying and shit.” On another upbeat NY joint, “Chun- Li”, one can actually dance a routine to the drum rhythms, or marvel at the steady bars and creative voices Nicki Minaj employs to get her vicious points across; “These birds copy every word, every inch / but gang gang got the hammer and the wrench / I pull up in that quarter milli off the lot / oh now she tryna be friends like I forgot.” Yes, mad copycats out there.At the end of the day though, many rappers have adopted her frenetic, nasally, theatrical style – when they can actually pull it off.Minaj never misses a step when she raps – whether you enjoy her flow or not.",

Unfortunately, with mainstream popularity also comes generic songwriting, turning once iconic Pop Punk & Emo bands into yet-another iteration of Fall Out Boy’s strings-&-horns-on-everything-while-screaming-monotonal-stories aesthetic.  Panic! At The Disco fell into this trap hard, leading to virtually every original member leaving the band as they became jaded & disinterested in the scene, but with Pray For The Wicked, front-man Brendon Urie proves he’s still got a spark of theatricality left in his heart keeping the machine turning."}, {"title": "Where Things Fell Apart", "content": "Upon releasing Pretty. Odd., Panic! At The Disco found themselves at the top of their game, producing thrilling Baroque Pop music with a distinct Indie Rock feel right as all their contemporaries started shifting towards a more processed, radio-friendly sound. They could’ve had the entire market to themselves at this point, as their retro-inspired songs reconnected youth audiences with the bombastic Rock music of legendary groups like The Beatles & The Beach Boys, but creative differences led to guitarist Ryan Ross & bassist Jon Walker leaving the band, a hit that would prove devastating as they were integral elements of the songwriting process. What followed was years of watered-down, basic AF Pop Rock that served to inflate Brendon Urie’s ego rather than exploring the band’s musicality; As such, they were soon usurped in popularity by Fun., becoming somewhat of a joke in the industry.", "datasource_id": "628CF4899F0F4E2E9C6A3DB2574AFB5D"}, {"title": "Figuring Out What’s Necessary For Entertainment", "content": "The problem with every Panic! At The Disco album from Vices & Virtues onward is that they dropped the one thing that made the band special: Their connection to the performing arts & drama – While there remained a hint of theatricality in Urie’s voice, the compositions themselves were devoid of life & character, sounding like any number of Fueled By Ramen’s other bombastic acts; In contrast, songs like “Roaring 20s” & “King Of The Clouds” off of Pray For The Wicked burst with colour & quirkiness, Urie’s voice ascending to the heavens with intricately-fluttering melodies whilst the underlying instrumentation churns out delightfully charismatic horn & string lines that compliment the song rather than feeling out of place, making for a more unique listening experience than your average mainstream Rock arrangement.", "datasource_id": "0D6E020940EE444599D32D521560C701"}, {"title": "Push Forward, But Don’t Forget Your Past", "content": "As refreshing as Pray For The Wicked is, Panic! At The Disco still manage to flub here & there with songs like crowd-favourite “High Hopes” that’re straight-up cookie-cutter Pop Rock, so far-removed from the band’s origins that you can actually hear the cash payout murdering any semblance of creativity; But then you have others likes “The Overpass” which beautifully combines nineties-era Breaks Beats percussion rhythms, early-noughties Pop Rock orchestral grandiosity & hopeful Emo Rock narrative arcs in a fantastic arrangement that respects the dramatic nature of the band’s youth, all the while upping the production values to unprecedented levels to situate the group as a heavy-hitter for years to come – Hell, even “Hey Look Ma, I Made It” manages to balance the band’s laidback aesthetics with modern instrumentation beautifully, the included puppetry music video so hilariously charming that your faith in their direction is restored wholeheartedly.", "datasource_id": "B0A7FDF0E3BC4245A78578DFB1280B2A"}, {"title": "The Future Of Brendon Urie’s Fantastic Platform", "content": "At the end of the day, Pray For The Wicked feels like a return to form for Panic! At The Disco, at least in terms of finding the spark that made them special in the first place. Brendon Urie has made it clear he wants to appeal to as wide an audience as possible & one listen to tracks like “Dying In LA” makes it very clear he wants to be the male equivalent of Adele one day, but with changes in his attitude after losing so many friends & the newfound pride he has in his craft after revealing details about his sexual orientation in 2018 it looks as though he’s ready to embrace the brilliant artist within once again, driving forward with the knowledge that the band will now be his platform of creativity rather than a cash-cow he needs to float upon – If you had been hoping to rediscover the joy of A Fever You Can’t Sweat Out, now is your time to come home!", "datasource_id": "C5617CF820B341E6BDDE2C987CE0EA9B"}]}`;
